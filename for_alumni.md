Hi Alumni, we cordially to invite you to <b>1. Human Library</b>, <b>2. Supper with Seniors</b>, and <b>3. Ask Me Anything (AMA) Telegram group!</b>
<br>

Tentatively, <br>

<b>Human Library</b> <br>
Human Library is an event where students can borrow “books” to have an informal conversation about experiences and interests.<br> "Books" are you guys, where you can share certain knowledge about the pillar, interest or anything in general to the freshmore students. <br>Students can view your short biography which gives them a rough idea of the kind of conversation they would like to talk about. <br>This allows the freshmore students to engage in great conversations with the SUTD community and obtain wonderful insights about the SUTD experience, future project opportunities, and more!<br>
By taking part in Human Library, you can be part of impacting and inspiring freshmore students through sharing your insights and experiences!<br>

What are you going to do as a "book" at the event itself? 1.Share your ideas and perspective with a small group of students about the pillar! 2. Have informal intimate conversations about anything in general!
