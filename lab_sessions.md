Here's a step by step guide to come onboard with us! :)

1. Take the [lab signup form template](https://forms.office.com/Pages/DesignPage.aspx?fragment=FormId%3Ddrd2NJDpck-5UGJImDFiPSPGuwVqkZ9EkYGLjfibzbNUOUZBSFBLUllOS0VSN0hEWTFMRlNIMTdDTS4u%26Token%3D0ef958dd63ce4f2b9288e15c0552c8a5) that we will be sending to the freshmores for each of your labs on our website. This form is for your labs to make the necessary preparations for your expected number freshmores coming to your labs on the day itself.

2. Duplicate the microsoft form on the template link. Click share -> Click "Get a link to duplicate" -> copy the link to duplicate -> paste in the other browser then proceed to step 3. 

3. Help us to fill in the portions in the form with the []. 

    Eg. Organised by: [Organiser Team's name] can be filled as Organised by: ROAR LAB. You can look out for the "[Fill in ...]" to demarcate the parts you need to fill in. 



4. The form is editable so that you can include the information that you need from the freshmores. For example, which lab sessions that they want to attend. 

5. Once you are done, do send us an [email](mailto:DiscoverSUTD-2021@SUTDAPAC.onmicrosoft.com) of the copy of the ms forms for your respective labs.
