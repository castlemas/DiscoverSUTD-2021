DiscoverSUTD  is a 3 week long introduction to the SUTD community. It will last from 13 September 2021 - 30 September 2021. It is an onboarding event for every incoming batch of freshmores. There are many parts to it. Fifth row sessions, lab visits, supper, human library as well as other parts to this 3 week long event. To get involve in this event, simply click on contributing for fifth row leaders or individual leaders. 

DiscoverSUTD was started by the team behind [OpenSUTD](https://opensutd.org/).

OpenSUTD is modelled after the idea of an Open Organisation, and we have community standards for all members to abide by in order to ensure a good environment for members to learn and contribute effectively.

>An Open Organization is one that engages participative communities both inside and out; responds to opportunities more quickly, has access to resources and talent outside the organization, and inspires, motivates, and empowers people at all levels to act.

This is why we are making sure that our project documents are kept open so that **you** can be a part of this process.
Read the "Posts" section at the bottom of this page if you're interested in going through our minutes.

# Concept
Adopting the model of a Conference with large-scale talks targeted at the general audience but also breakout sessions that participants can sign-up for on an individualised manner.

**Emphasis on personal agency to allow for self-discovery of SUTD's ecosystem.**

# Objectives
1. For Freshmores - understand the spaces (virtual and physical), avenues for resources and communities in SUTD in order to embody the desired culture
Culture embodying the spirit of innovation, collaboration, having self-initiated projects, self-directed learning and broad-based skill integration.

2. For SUTD - celebrate the work done by our research community, 5th rows and housing (specifically amongst seniors)
Showcase the potential of UROPs and taking up research projects in SUTD, similar to LCC in an interactive/ experiential manner

# But what does this mean?
We will
1. **Support** Fifth Rows by providing a budget for you to hold workshops that cater to Freshmores. There's just a small catch, do follow the template we provide to facilitate preparing the event schedule.
2. **Organise** community sesions in the form of a Human Library, and Housing events.
3. **Bring together** the larger graduate and research community in the SUTD ecosystem through tours and meet ups.
4. **Provide** a consistent visual branding throughout the event.
