**Fifth Row Sessions**

We intend to adhere to these principles:
1. Equitable - Fifth Rows that want to do a workshop will have the chance to, especially if there is a proven track record of doing excellent sessions.
2. Fair - all workshops conducted well should be supported.
3. Incentivise right behaviour - we should provide funds to encourage a more hands-on approach, quality instructors, well-prepared material.

We'd like to support Fifth Rows in reaching out to the Freshmores but also to help Freshmores make sense of what Fifth Rows suit them best. Specifically through clear communication and categorising our workshops into tracks based on skills taught.


**Human Library**

Have speakers act as ‘books’ and you can ‘borrow’ their time. Execution-wise, have students ‘borrow’ the books for a fixed timeslot and rotate every hour. Possibly just have the professors at their office/ location of their choice and students can come by. Think of it as an informal way to Discover the people behind SUTD. Previous [human libraries](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UvHSNurYQyQ7Fpd3hj5LVKAsEBCkx3GNzvsFQXgqCRw/edit#) held at SUTD saw not just Professors but also researchers and students being our books.

Not only you get to consult the wise, you'll have the chance to meet energetic Interest Groups' leaders and other outstanding Projects that our SUTDents like to show-off. ;) 
*We need coordinators for this event!*


**Pillar Sessions**

Experential session to expose to students what Pillar life will be like. Focus on a skill or lesson methodology that is representative of what we do once we enter our Pillars.

**Housing Sessions**

All the information you need about Housing, get to know your House Guardian, and your friendly neighbours ~

**Supper with Seniors sessions**

Yes you heard that right! We will be providing supper most days of the week to encourage Freshmores to stay for workshops and activities after class. Also we hope that having the cohort gather regularly might help in building a stronger community through encouraging people to share about their day, hopes and experiences at SUTD. 

**AMA session**

Still in doubt?  Don't sleep on it! Join our AskmeAnything (AMA) sessions to get them off your chest. You can expect to chat with our friendly seniors and learn from their ✨ _experiences_ ✨ . (Tip: ask them for their favourite foodstall in the canteen)

**Lab session**

This session organised by labs has the following aims: <br/>
1. To introduce freshmores to labs that they can potentially explore for their masters or phd or even summer internships and also look at some hiring opportunities.<br/>
2. To also introduce the different labs in SUTD on what they do to inspire freshmores. <br/>
If You are a lab manager, take a look at the lab sessions tab if you are interested in taking part as a lab to host a session for the freshmores.
