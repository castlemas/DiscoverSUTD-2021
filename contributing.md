**Overall Contribution Workflow**

1. Submit a proposal through Github Issues on our master repository
2. We will reply to your issue and review it.
3. Once it is reviewed and cleared, we will notify you.

Please do note that the planning team is small and we ask for your patience. It will take time to clear sesssions with the staff but rest assured we receive all proposals.

**I would like to hold a session**

If you're a Fifth Row leader, a Senior or alumni and would like to hold a workshop for Freshmores.

1. Go to our [issue](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/DiscoverSUTD-2021-microsite/issues/new/choose) templates
2. Click on "Get started" under Session Proposal
3. Please provide us the details of your session. We would like to emphasise that we would like you to *italicise* the specific skills/takeaways from your session.

For examples of other workshops that are pretty good, take a look at [Deep Learning Workshop](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/deeplearning-workshop-2019).

Also take a look at what other Fifth Rows are [planning](https://github.com/OpenSUTD/DiscoverSUTD-2021-microsite/issues).

Our team looks forward to working closely with you in this event as far as possible.

**I would like to be a part of the team**

For visual branding:
We've requested for a budget! Since we're a design school, our efforts need to not just be conceptually sound but aesthetically pleasing. To alleviate the work, possibly looking at seeking freelancers to prepare material.
1. assist session organisers to maintain a consistent visual brand throughout the event
2. produce graphics for curated tracks and programs
